This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

# Yell Clone

A partial clone of Yell.com, with only few views and a small subset of the features covered. This project originally started out as a simple exercise to mimic the form functionality found on the homepage for my own practice, but has grown slightly since then. 

Views covered include the Home page, results page and shortlist page. Businesses can be searched for, (a number of random business profiles are constructed when the app initializes, see the links below for more details) and the results can be then be filtered or sorted, and will be also be paginated if there are enough results. Businesses can also be added to and removed from the shortlist. 

It goes without saying that this is far from a production ready implementation, it is merely something built for my own practice. 

Whilst this isn't hosted anywhere, the repo can be cloned and ran locally via the npm start command, which will make it available on
http://localhost:3000
